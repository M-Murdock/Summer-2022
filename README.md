# Summer-2022

`GreekExercises.ipynb` contains some rough preliminary code for checking English -> Greek translations. As of right now, it can only identify individual Greek words which are obviously incorrect. Word lists are pulled from Pharr.

`HomericaQuizzes.ipynb` contains preliminary code for interactive exercises based on the [Homerica quizzes](https://github.com/gregorycrane/Homerica/tree/master/quizzes). As of now, error-checking is extremely basic (i.e. it can check accents and determine whether the input matches the specified answer exactly). Also: the regex I'm using to read each quiz question is not 100% accurate all the time, and probably needs to be tweaked a little.
